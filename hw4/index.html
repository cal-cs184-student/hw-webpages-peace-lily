		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>This homework focused on creating realistic cloth and surface modeling. I began by implementing the grid of masses and springs, which allowed me to represent a cloth as a grid of point masses, and I was able to connect these masses together using springs. There are different types of springs that connect different pairs of point masses throughout the cloth, which represent how points in the cloth affect other points during movement. I then implemented simulating movement in the cloth by calculating the force exerted on each point, calculating the points new position, and constraining the point movement based on the spring type. I then dealt with collisions, both between the cloth and other objects using ray-intersection formulas, as well as between the cloth with itself. The final step was implementing different shading techniques.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, I enjoyed this project a lot because it was visually appealing and my interest in the aesthetic aspect of graphics is part of the reason I took CS184. The write up portion of the homework encouraged me to examine the impacts of different features (dampening, density, and ks) to view the effect on the cloth. I thought this was especially interesting because it made me think about how different materials would react differently in different scenes, and how the cloth simulation is just one part of an overall scene. For instance, if the cloth were wet (or even submerged in water) modifying the dampening, density, and ks could replicate this effect. I thought the optimization aspect of this homework (i.e. the hash table of self collisions) was also interesting and it gave me an appreciation for the ways programers work to optimize the overall program.</p>

		</table>
		<p>Lower ks values (i.e. 50) result in the springs having more flexibility. Thus the cloth on the left has springs that are much more flexible (and therefore more resistant to force). The left cloth continued to move even in it's "rest" state. Alternatively, the right cloth was much more stiff and its springs were more resistant to force. Thus the cloth has less movement in the fabric.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>High density values result in similar renders to low ks values. While low ks values make the springs more suseptible to force high density values will increase the mass of each point, making any force on the cloth more pronounced, which leads to greater movement/wrinkles in the cloth. Alternatively, lower density means a smaller value for mass/volume, so any force will be multiplied by a smaller coefficent and will be less pronounced.</p>

		</table>
		<p> A high dampening factor means there is more resistance to the cloth, so the cloth settles slowly but ultimately reaches it's rest state relatively fast. The cloth is much more stiff as it falls. Alternatively, a low dampening value results in much more movement. The cloth faces less resistance and moves a lot, wiggling around before eventually coming to a halt. However, it takes a long time to reach the rest state due to so much movement.</p>

		<p>
			The sphere is defined by the sphere's origin and it's radius. To measure weather the cloth collided with the sphere, I measured the distance between the point mass's <code>position</code> and the origin of the sphere, using euclidian norm: <code>(position - origin).norm()</code>. If the distance is less than the radius of the sphere, the point mass in the cloth must have intersected the sphere, and I adjust the <code>position</code> of the point mass to reflect the intersection by adding an offset/correction to the point mass's <code>position</code> at the last timestep (<code>last_position</code>). In order to adjust the position, I apply a correction <code>Vector3D</code>, which is the tangent point (where the pointmass intersects the sphere) subtracted from the point mass's last position. The correction factor is then multiplied by <code>(1 - friction)</code> and added to the point masses last point.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The spring constant, <code>ks</code>, determines the flexibility of the springs. This is very prominent across different <code>ks</code> values. For instance, <code>ks = 50,000</code> results in a very stiff cloth, because the higher <code>ks</code> value indicates that the springs are less elastic and therefore more resistant to force (in this case, the main force is gravity) which causes the cloth to lie quite stifly. Lower <code>ks</code> values result in more flexibility of the cloth, for instance <code>ks = 500</code> shows a very flexible cloth that outlines the sphere quite well. I experimented with <code>ks = 50</code> and noticed that the springs because so elastic that the cloth began to lack shape, and the folds became harder to distinguish.
			</p>
		
		<b> Plane </b>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/plane.png" alt="Cloth draped over plane" style="width:70%"/>
				<figcaption>A green cloth drapped over the plane.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The plane is defined by a point on the plane (<code>p'</code>) and a normal vector (<code>N</code>). I reviewed the ray tracing lecture (Lecture 9) to decide how to test intersection. I ultimately used the ray intersection with plane equation from Lecture 9. In lecture, the ray is defined as <code>origin + time_step * direction</code>, and in the case of the point mass, I can determine the origin from <code>last_position</code> and the direction is equal to <code>position - last_position</code>. To determine the location of the intersection, I assign <code>t</code> to <code>t = dot((p' - last_position), N) / dot(direction, N)</code>. <code>t</code> tells me how far along the direction vector the point occurs, if <code>t</code> is between <code>[0, 1]</code> then the collision occurs between <code>last_position</code> and the current <code>position</code>. I then calculate the exact intersection point (the tangent point) as <code>last_position + t * direction</code>. I then apply a correction to <code>last_position</code> and scale the correction by <code>(1 - friction)</code>. This correction places the new <code>position</code> at slightly above the tangent point.
			</p>
				
		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<p>
			In order to implement self-collisions within the cloth, I subdivided our 3D space into 3D boxes. The point masses that lie within the same box are likely to collide with each other, so comparing a given point to its neighbors (other point masses within the same box) is much faster than comparing it to every other point mass in the cloth. In order to store the neighbors (essentially all the point masses that share the same 3D box) I created a hash table, where the key is symbolic of which 3D box the points lie in, and the value is a vector of <code>PointMass</code> objects.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I had a challenging time determining how to create an accurate hash function, however I read on Ed that converting the 3D coordinates to a 1D coordinate index system was useful. Based on this, I divided each position coordinate (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>) by the side of the box (given by <code>w</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>t</code> respectively) and then used <code>floor()</code> to round the results. This allowed me to determine the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code> values of which box the point was in. I then used the following equation (which I derived on my own but confirmed through a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7367770/how-to-flatten-or-index-3d-array-in-1d-array"> Stack Overflow </a> post) to find my hash value: <code>key = z_idx * num_width_points * num_height_points + y_idx * num_width_points + x_idx</code>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			After the point masses for the cloth have been placed in the hash table (in <code>build_spatial_map</code>) I implemented <code>self_collide</code>. This compares a given point mass to all of its neighbors (which is found in the hash table) and measures if the distance between the point mass and its neighbor is less than or equal to <code>2 * thickness</code>. If the distance is less than this metric, the two points must have collided. In this case, to prevent the cloth from "falling through" itself, I calculate a correction factor for each intersection, which is <code>-(2 * thickness - the distance between the two points)</code>. This allows the fabric to lay on top of itself rather than falling through. I scale this correction factor by the unit vector of the distance between the two points, in order to ensure the correction factor is a <code>Vector3D</code> object. The final correction for the point mass is the average correction vector across its neighbors, divided by the number of simulation steps.

		<p>High density has a very noticable effect on the cloth. From timestep 10, it's immediately aparent that the high density weighs the bottom of the cloth such that most of the visible movement occurs at the bottom of the cloth. Unlike the default values, there are minimal ripples throughout the cloth and the ripples that do occur are at the bottom. The cloth also falls in on itself in a more dramatic manner, with harsher transitions and more wrinkles.</p>

		</table>
		<p>The main difference at lower density is that the ripples in the cloth are larger and less dramatic. In Table 3, there are fewer but larger ripples as the ripples that do exist extend to the rest of the cloth.</p>

			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>At a high ks value, there is less movement in the cloth, which makes sense as ks is correlated to the flexibility of the springs. This is most prominent in the final frame: the cloth has spread across the plane less than it did at the default ks, and the folds that do exist appear stiff.

		</table>
		<p>At a low ks value there is more movement in the cloth, making the cloth fold in on itself more in the final stages. Note that at timestep 100, the cloth is flatter than it is at the same timestep for the default ks value.</p>

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<p>Shaders occur in our rasterization pipeline and can operate on vectexes (vertex shaders) or on entire fragments (fragment shaders). Shaders work like a program: they can have functions, they take in arguments, they have shared attributes across instances of the running program (called a uniform) which may be objects like light position. Per-vertex operations occur before per-fragment operations in the rasterization pipeline, so vertex shaders may write in values (called varying) into the fragment shader; shaders often operate on both vertices and fragments. Vertex shaders often modify geometric properties (like position) whereas fragment shaders modify attributes like color (based off of the values passed to it by the vertex shader). </p>

		</table>
		<p>
			Blinn-Phong shading utilizes three aspects of shading to create a more accurate, smooth shading result.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Ambient shading is shading that does not depend on anything, it is a constant color that is added to the entire cloth/texture. I selected a black background color because the reference photo seemed to have a lot of shadows. It is calculated as \( k_a \cdot I_a \)
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Diffuse shading is calculated independent of view direction but still incorporates the light source and vertex normal. Diffuse shading uses a diffuse coefficient \( k_d \), considers the illumination at the time of intersection \( \frac{I}{r^2} \), and ensures that the vertex normal is non negative. It is calculated as \( k_d \cdot \frac{I}{r^2} \cdot \max(0.0, \text{dot}(n, l)) \)
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Specular shading models bright points in the image, namely points of reflection. I utilized a high value for \( p \) and a low value for \( k_s \) based on the lecture slides. It is calculated as \( k_s \cdot \frac{I}{r^2} \cdot \max(0.0, \text{dot}(n, h))^p \)
